This abstraction layer should introduce typed variables. 
Variable assignments and operations may only take place on the same type (thus no mixed types, casting has to be done explicitly still). 
Here the types 'int16', 'uint16' and 'float16' are introduced (IR needs unsigned operations then!)
as well as 'int8' and 'uint8', which will be treated like a normal 16-bit value but the bits will be explicitly masked with 0x00ff. 
(IMPORTANT: How to deal with signed 8 bits? Bit extension to emulate. When 8-bit signed is negative, set upper 8 bits to 1, making it true 16-bit negative)
Also 'int32' and 'uint32' are present...?

Casts are done C-style, like
uint16 vari;
vari = 123;
float16 varf;
varf = (float16) vari;


but how do we deal with literals?
float16 varf;
varf = 1;       // integer 1!
I guess now our problem, still need to explicitly use right literal types... 
So the above example would translate to varf = 0.0000001f or something similar

Everything stays the same, but operations are automatically type adjusted
